# Webhooks

## Overview

This topic explains how to create and use webhooks in FeatBit. FeatBit's webhooks allow you to build your own
integrations that subscribe to flag/segment changes in FeatBit. When a feature flag or a segment is updated,
FeatBit sends an HTTP POST payload to the webhook's configured URL.
