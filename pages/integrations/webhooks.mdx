# Webhooks

## Overview

This topic explains how to create and use webhooks in FeatBit. FeatBit's webhooks allow you to build your own
integrations that subscribe to flag/segment changes in FeatBit. When a feature flag or a segment is updated,
FeatBit sends an HTTP POST payload to the webhook's configured URL.

## Creating a webhook

To create a webhook:

1. Navigate to the **Integrations/Webhooks** page in the FeatBit dashboard.
2. Click **Add Webhook**.
3. Enter a human-readable **Name** for the webhook.
4. Enter the **URL** that FeatBit should send the HTTP POST payload to.
5. Select the **Scopes(environments)** that this webhook should monitor. The webhook will be triggered for events in any of the selected environments.
6. Select the **Events** you would like to trigger this webhook.
7. Optionally, you can add some custom **Headers** to the webhook request. Checkout "[Delivery headers](#delivery-headers)" for more information.
8. Configure the **Payload Template**. This is a Handlebars template that will be used to generate the payload sent to the webhook URL. Checkout "[Payload template](#payload-template)" for more information.
9. Optionally, enter a secret. If you enter a secret, FeatBit will send the secret in the **X-FeatBit-Signature-256** header of the webhook payload. Checkout "[Validating webhook deliveries](#validating-webhook-deliveries)" for more information.
10. Set the webhook **Active** status.
11. Optionally, you can perform a **Live Debug** before saving the webhook. This will send a test payload to the webhook URL and show the request/response details. Checkout "[Live Debug](#live-debug)" for more information.
12. Click **Save**.

## Delivery headers

HTTP POST payloads that are delivered to your webhook's configured URL endpoint will contain several built-in headers:

- `X-FeatBit-Delivery`: A globally unique identifier (GUID) to identify the delivery.
- `X-FeatBit-Event`: The name of the event(s) that triggered the delivery.
- `X-FeatBit-Hook-ID`: The unique identifier of the webhook.
- `X-FeatBit-Signature-256`: This header is sent if the webhook is configured with a `secret`. This is the HMAC hex digest of the request body, and is generated using the SHA-256 hash function and the `secret` as the HMAC `key`. For more information, see "[Validating webhook deliveries](#validating-webhook-deliveries)".

Besides the built-in headers, you can also add custom headers to the webhook request. This can be useful if you want to add some authentication headers to the request.
