## Overview

This section describes a temporary method for exporting feature flag usage data and experiment events to your preferred data store or warehouse. This allows you to analyze the data using your own tools and systems.

As the diagram above shows, the current process involves extracting data from FeatBit's ClickHouse database (or MongoDB for the standard version) and then transferring it to a third-party or your own Custom Data Platform, Message Brokers, Data Warehouse, etc.

> We refer to this as the '**temporary method**' because it's an interim measure while we better understand the specific needs and best practices of each customer. We invite you to [join our Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/featbit/shared_invite/zt-1ew5e2vbb-x6Apan1xZOaYMnFzqZkGNQ) channel for further discussion on this topic, or you can email us at `contact@featbit.co` for more information.
