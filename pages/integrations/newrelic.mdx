# New Relic One

FeatBit offers the following ways to integrate with New Relic One:

1. FeatBit sends feature flag change events to New Relic as deployment events and then can be used for change tracking, for example.
2. Use a FeatBit trigger (or API) to toggle a flag's targeting on or off when a performance metric drops below a certain threshold.

## Using the New Relic One events integration

### Subscribe flag changes then send to New Relic One

You can use FeatBit's Webhook to subscribe to changes in Feature Flags, then create an event sender for New Relic One.

The related documentation will be provided after the Webhook feature is released.

### Analyze Deployment Impact in APM

To view FeatBit events in New Relic One, navigate to your application's APM dashboard and select the app you have configured for the New Relic One webhook. You can then track changes via:

1. The Summary page, to directly view the impact of that flag change.
2. The Change Tracking page, to view the deployment events.

For example, the figure above illustrates:

1. An abnormal increase in Web Transaction Time and Errors after a feature flag is turned on.
2. A critical issue is detected.
3. Shortly afterward, a feature flag turn-off deployment event occurs.
4. The response time peak and errors return to normal.
5. The critical issue is resolved.

You can click on the activity stream items to clearly see what happened before and after the deployment event.

## Using flag triggers with New Relic One

You can use FeatBit's triggers to toggle a flag's targeting on or off when a performance metric drops below a certain threshold. [New Relic One's Webhook](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/webhook-notifications) allows you to notify your services when a metric alert is triggered. In the Webhook configuration, you can choose to directly call a [FeatBit Flag Trigger](../feature-flags/feature-workflow/flag-triggers) to toggle on/off a feature flag, or call a [FeatBit REST API](../api-docs/using-featbit-rest-api) rollout/rollback to a specific group of users. Here's an example of how I created alert in the sample above:

1. Click on Button "Set up alerts"

1. You need to first create a Flag Trigger in a Feature Flags. See [Workflow/Flag Triggers](/feature-flags/feature-workflow/flag-triggers).
