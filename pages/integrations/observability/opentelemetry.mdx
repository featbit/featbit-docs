# Open Telemetry

## Overview

FeatBit's backend services, including the Api, Evaluation-Server, and Data Analytic Service, are instrumented with
OpenTelemetry to publish observability metrics, traces, and logs, enabling you to gain insights into FeatBit's
performance and behavior.

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration

To enable OpenTelemetry, the following environment variables need to be set for each service:

- `ENABLE_OPENTELEMETRY`: Tells the app that OpenTelemetry is enabled. Set to `true` to enable OpenTelemetry.
- `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`: This is used to identify the service in the observability backends. Set to the name of the
  service. For example, `featbit-api` for the Api service, `featbit-els` for the Evaluation-Server service,
  and `featbit-das` for the Data Analytic service.
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`: Sets the **grpc endpoint** of the OpenTelemetry exporter. For
  example: `http://otel-collector:4317`.

### Additional Configuration

FeatBit's Api and Evaluation-Server services are written in .NET/C#, are instrumented with
using [.NET Automatic Instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/net/automatic/). For a complete list of
supported environment variables, refer to
the [documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-instrumentation/blob/main/docs/config.md).

The Data Analytic service, written in Python, is instrumented using
the [Python Automatic Instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/python/automatic/). For a complete list
of supported environment variables, refer to
the [documentation](https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sdk/environment_variables.html).

## A Ready-To-Run Example

We have a ready-to-run example for you to try out OpenTelemetry. In this example, we
use [Seq](https://docs.datalust.co/docs/getting-started-with-docker) for
logs, [Jaeger](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger) for traces,
and [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) for metrics.

Follow the steps below to run the example:

```shell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/featbit/featbit.git
cd featbit

# Build the test images
docker compose --project-directory .  -f ./docker/composes/docker-compose-dev.yml build

# Start OTEL collector, Seq, Jaeger, and Prometheus
docker compose --project-directory .  -f ./docker/composes/docker-compose-otel-collector-contrib.yml up -d

# Start FeatBit services
docker compose --project-directory .  -f ./docker/composes/docker-compose-otel.yml up -d
```

Use FeatBit as normal, create feature flags, evaluate flags, view flag insights, etc. Then

- View logs in Seq at http://localhost:8082
- View traces in Jaeger at http://localhost:16686
- View metrics in Prometheus at http://localhost:9090
