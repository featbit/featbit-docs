SSO is available on FeatBit(an [open source feature flags](https://www.featbit.co/blogs/Free-and-Open-Source-Feature-Flag-Tools) service) Self-hosted via OpenID Connect. To enable SSO on your self-hosted FeatBit instance, you will need an active license key, and then you may add the SSO settings for your provider.

## SSO Settings

To enable SSO, you will need to add the following settings

### Add environment variable for the FeatBit Api service

- `SSOEnabled`: Set to `true` to enable SSO.

### Add OpenId Connect settings via UI

Once FeatBit successfully launched, go to the UI **http://localhost:8081/workspace** and add the following settings:

- `clientId`: The OIDC client ID.
- `clientSecret`: The OIDC client secret.
- `redirectUri`: The OIDC redirect URI.
- `tokenEndpoint`: The OIDC token endpoint.
- `clientAuthenticationMethod`: The OIDC client authentication method. Set to `client_secret_post` for most of the time, we also support `client_secret_basic`.
- `authorizationEndpoint`: The OIDC authorization endpoint.
- `scope`: The OIDC scopes to request. Set to `openid profile email` for most of the time.
- `userEmailClaim`: The OIDC user email claim. Set to `email` if you use the above scope.

## Example

We have tested FeatBit SSO with **Keycloak, Okta, and Auth0**. Here's a step-by-step guide using Keycloak as an example.

### 1. Run Keycloak
Run keycloak from docker and log in the admin console with `admin`/`admin` at [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)

```bash
docker run -d -p 9000:8080 -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin --name=keycloak quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:22.0.1 start-dev
```

### 2. Create a realm

Create a new realm called `featbit` and switch to that realm

### 3. Create an OIDC Client

Create an OIDC client with these settings, here are some important settings:
- Set the client's Valid Redirect URIs to http://localhost:8081/* (FeatBit UI service address)
- Set the client's Web Origins to http://localhost:8081/* (FeatBit UI service address)
- Enable Client authentication

### 4. Create a User
Create a user on KeyCloak and set a password for that user

### 5. Start FeatBit

Setting the following environment variables for FeatBit Api Service in `docker-compose.yml`.

```yaml
SSOEnabled=true
```

Start FeatBit and you should be able to see the SSO tab on the login page.
```bash
cd featbit
docker-compose up -d
```

Then click the `Login` tab and log in with the default credentials `test@featbit.com`/`123456`

### 6. Configure OIDC Settings

Go to **http://localhost:8081/workspace** and add your OpenID Connect settings and click on **Update**, please **replace the client secret** with your own value

### 7. Log In with SSO

Copy the workspace key in the **General settings**, you will need it when login with SSO

![](../integrations/assets/single-sign-on/ws-key.png)

Log out and click SSO, use the workspace key copied earlier.
Click **Continue** and the browser should take you to the Keycloak login page, then you can log in with the user you created previously.
