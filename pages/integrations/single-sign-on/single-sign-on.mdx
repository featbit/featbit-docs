SSO is available on FeatBit(an [open source feature flags](https://www.featbit.co/blogs/Free-and-Open-Source-Feature-Flag-Tools) service) Self-hosted via OpenID Connect. To enable SSO on your self-hosted FeatBit instance, you will need an active license key, and then you may add the SSO settings for your provider.

## SSO Settings

To enable SSO, you will need to add the following settings

### Add environment variable for the FeatBit Api service (You can skip this step if you are using FeatBit SaaS)

- `SSOEnabled`: Set to `true` to enable SSO.

### Add OpenId Connect settings via UI

Once FeatBit successfully launched, go to the UI **http://localhost:8081/workspace** (**https://app.featbit.co/en/workspace** if using SaaS) and add the following settings:

- `clientId`: The OIDC client ID.
- `clientSecret`: The OIDC client secret.
- `tokenEndpoint`: The OIDC token endpoint.
- `clientAuthenticationMethod`: The OIDC client authentication method. Set to `client_secret_post` for most of the time, we also support `client_secret_basic`.
- `authorizationEndpoint`: The OIDC authorization endpoint.
- `scope`: The OIDC scopes to request. Set to `openid profile email` for most of the time.
- `userEmailClaim`: The OIDC user email claim. Set to `email` if you use the above scope.
