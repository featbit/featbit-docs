## Overview

This is a step-by-step guide using Auth0 as an Identity Provider (IdP) and FeatBit as a Service Provider (SP) to authenticate users to FeatBit.

The final configuration should be similar to the following:
```json
{
    "clientId": "eI9NSqLyw03WqKhMT2h1McqNf4Wre86W",
    "clientSecret": "ZghOBGxQrrcj1Iw3DdJiRE5k6TgPFJT_epSUG7v0XPibS7IWxRdIL8_bS7OLyw1J",
    "tokenEndpoint": "https://dev-nyi0i4bvcwpfd0ca.us.auth0.com/oauth/token",
    "clientAuthenticationMethod": "client_secret_post",
    "authorizationEndpoint": "https://dev-nyi0i4bvcwpfd0ca.us.auth0.com/authorize",
    "userEmailClaim": "email",
    "scope": "openid profile email"
}
```
