# Introduction
 
FeatBit is an open-source feature flag management tool that empowers developers:

**Ship Code Safely**. Mitigate risks with Production Testing, roll out features to 1% of users initially then expanding progressively, and ensure instant error recovery without redeployment.

**Targeted Experiences**. Giving you control over who sees each feature and when they see it. Release features to specific target users, and continuously measure and improve your buisness.

**Innovate Faster**. Decouples code deployments from feature releases. Deploy at will, and release any feature immediately upon request from the boss.

**Host Anywhere**. FeatBit allows you to host your feature flags service wherever your business needs it, ensuring compliance and data protection.

**Born for developers**. Use simple if/else statements to control and release features, eliminating complex DevOps tasks. This enables developers to directly drive business value.
