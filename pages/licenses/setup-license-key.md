# Set up license key

This article will demonstrate how to set up FeatBit with a license key.

# Get workspace Id

You will need the workspace Id to request a license key, whether it's a trial license key or a commercial license key. 

1. Make sure your FeatBit is running, we assume the FeatBit UI is available at http://localhost:8081
2. Login into FeatBit with your email and password. If the default settings are used, you can use the default account: 
   - Username: test@featbit.com
   - Password: 123456
  
3. Go to http://localhost:8081/en/workspace, in the **License settings** section, click the **Copy** button
