This guide illustrates the process of setting up FeatBit with a license key.

## Obtain Workspace ID

Before acquiring a license key, you need the workspace ID. Follow these steps:

1. Make sure your FeatBit is running, and we assume the FeatBit UI is available at http://localhost:8081
2. Log in to FeatBit using your email and password. For default settings, use:
   - Username: test@featbit.com
   - Password: 123456
  
3. Go to http://localhost:8081/en/workspace, in the **License Settings** section, click the **Copy** button
