# API

<Callout type="info">
The current article is a general introduction of how to make requests to the FeatBit REST API, for a complete list of the APIs and how to use each of them, we have made a redoc powered document available [here](https://featbit-tio-eu-api.azurewebsites.net/docs/index.html). If you are running FeatBit locally or on your server, you can also point to the url: <strong>URL\_OF\_API\_SERVER/docs.</strong> For example, the url should be <strong>http://localhost:5000/docs</strong> if you are running FeatBit on your local machine without https.

### Authentication

All REST API resources are authenticated with either [personal or service access tokens](../integrations/api-access-tokens.md). Other authentication mechanisms are not supported. You can manage personal access tokens on **Integration/Access tokens** page.

#### Authentication using request header

The only way to authenticate with the API is by adding an `Authorization` header containing your access token to your requests. The value of the `Authorization` header must be your access token. To learn how to add this header, please refer to [Using FeatBit REST API](using-featbit-rest-api.md).

### Representations

All resources expect and return JSON response bodies. Error responses also send a JSON body. To learn more about the error format of the API, read [Errors](overview.md#errors).

In practice this means that you always get a response with a `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`.

In addition, request bodies for `PATCH`, `POST`, and `PUT` requests must be encoded as JSON with a `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`.

### Errors

The API always returns errors in a common format. Here's an example:

```json
{
    "success": false,
    "errors": [
        "Unauthorized"
    ],
    "data": null
}
```

The **errors** indicates the general class of error.

### CORS

The FeatBit API supports Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for AJAX requests from any origin. If an `Origin` header is given in a request, it will be echoed as an explicitly allowed origin. Otherwise the request returns a wildcard, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. For more information on CORS, read the [CORS W3C Recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors). Example CORS headers might look like:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Accept, Content-Type, Content-Length, Accept-Encoding, Authorization
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: OPTIONS, GET, DELETE, PATCH
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Max-Age: 300
```

You can make authenticated CORS calls just as you would make same-origin calls, using either access token authentication. You should never expose your access tokens to untrusted entities.
