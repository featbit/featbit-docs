# Teams

## Overview

This topic explains how to manage team members, team maintainers, and team permissions in FeatBit.

## **Managing members in default Team**

At the moment, FeatBit provides only one default team. You can create, update, delete and manage members on the team page in the IAM section.\

The new member was created with an initial password. It would be best if you paste it to your colleague.

Unfortunately, you can't modify your password at the moment. You can upvote the feature suggestion in [FeatBit's discussion](https://github.com/featbit/featbit/discussions/106).

### Delete a member from the team

You can remove a member from **IAM - Team** page. Click the **Remove** button of the member/user you want to delete from the list. Member/User won't be able to log in if it's not in the team list.
