# Overview

FeatBit is a fast, scalable, and popular open source feature flags management service. 

- **Ship Code Safely**. Mitigate risks with Production Testing, roll out new features to 1% of users initially then expanding, and ensure instant error recovery without redeployment.
- **Innovate Faster**. Decouple feature deployment from release to minimize merge conflicts. Deploy at will, and release any feature immediately upon request from the boss.
- **Targeted Experiences**. Release features to specific target users, and continuously measure and improve the product's business value, while reducing the need for developer involvement.
- **Simple Experimentation**. Use A/B testing to compare the performance of different features, and use the results to make data-driven decisions.
- **Born for developers**. Use simple code to control and release features, eliminating complex DevOps tasks. This enables developers to directly drive business value.
