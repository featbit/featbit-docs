# The flags list

## Overview

This topic explains how to use the feature flags list, which shows your feature flags and gives you options to create, modify, and manage them.

## Viewing feature flags

All of your feature flags **within an environment** appear on the flags list. Creating a new flag adds it to the list, and archiving a flag removes it from the list. You can use the search bar to find a flag by name, key, tag, or status.

By default, the most recently updated flags appear first, and archived flags **will not** be shown in the list. To view the archived flag list, you need to check the 'Archived' checkbox.

<Callout type="info">
**NOTE:** A suggested key auto-populates when you enter the name, you'll use this key to reference the flag in your code. After you save the flag key, you **cannot modify** it. You can change a flag's name, however, whenever you want.
</Callout>

You just created a feature flag. It appears in the list.

5. Click **Ok** button.

**Note: The Targeting user and rules will not be copied.** Because one of your rules may references a segment that does not exist in the target environment and the targeting user also may not exist in the target environment.
