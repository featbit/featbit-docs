## Using the flag evaluations graph

The flag evaluations graph gives your engineering and product teams insight into how many times users are receiving each variation of a flag over time.

To view a flag's evaluations graph:

1. Navigate to the flags list.
2. Click the name of the flag you want to view evaluations over time for. The flag's **Insights** tab appears.
3.  Click the **Insights** tab. The flag evaluations graph appears:

Flag evaluations graphs are generated on a per-flag evaluation basis, not a per-user basis. This means that if the same user is evaluated 20 times, the flag evaluations graph records and displays all 20 evaluations.

## Using the end-user's flag variation table

Below the flag evaluation graph, there is an end-user's flag variation table that tells your team what variation an end-user has gotten over time.
