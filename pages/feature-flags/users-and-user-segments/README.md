# Users and user segments

This category has documentation topics about FeatBit users. Users are people, services, machines, or other resources that encounter feature flags in your product.

Any identifier that uniquely corresponds to a target is designated as a user. They appear in the **Users** list after they are identified by a FeatBit SDK. You can manage the way users interact with feature flags, and which users encounter which flags, by targeting flags to user attributes or user segments. You can even choose which users to include or exclude in the user data you collect.

Read the content in this category to understand how users and user segments interact with feature flags.
