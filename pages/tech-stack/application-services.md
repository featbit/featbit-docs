# Application Services

FeatBit consists of four application services, each with its own responsibilities and features. The services are
designed to work together seamlessly, providing a comprehensive solution for feature management and experimentation.

FeatBit is designed to be microservice-oriented, allowing for easy scaling and deployment. Each service can be deployed
independently, enabling teams to choose the best deployment strategy for their needs. The services can be run in a
single instance or distributed across multiple instances, depending on the scale of the application and the requirements
of the organization.
