* **SDK:** We provide SDKs for all major languages and frameworks, providing quick access to FeatBit from your services and applications.

## Data flows

When the system is running, data flows between different services. There are four main data flows:

### Data sync (feature flags / Segments) data flow

The feature flag / Segment data is stored in MongoDB, it is the most important data store and serves for all major features of FeatBit.

After a connection has been established between a client or server SDK and evaluation server, the SDK would send a data sync request attached with the timestamp of the latest changes to evaluation server, evaluation server will check that timestamp and fetch eligible feature flags and segments from Redis, after an eventual evaluation process (only for client SDK), the result would be sent back to SDK. The response has one of the two types:

* **full**: the response contains all feature flags and segments
* **patch**: the response contains only the new feature flags and segments created or updated since the timestamp

### Feature flag / Segment changes data flow

When a user changes a feature flag or a segment from the UI, in addition to store data in MongoDB, the API server also pushes the changes to Kafka, Evaluation server reads those changes, update Redis, evaluate feature flags related to the changes and sends related feature flags or evaluation results to client/server side SDK through WebSocket connections.

### End user data flow

End user data is stored in MongoDB and serves for feature flag and segment targeting.

When client SDK establishes a WebSocket connection or switches to another user (by calling the identify API), or client/server SDK sends track message,  Evaluation server sends end user information to Kafka, then API server reads that data and update/insert into MongoDB.

### Feature flag and metric track data flow

Feature flag and metric track data is stored in ClickHouse and serves for A/B/n testing (experimentation) and reporting.

When client/server SDK sends feature flag and metric track messages to Evaluation server, the latter forwards the track messages to Kafka, Data analytics servers reads track messages from Kafka and stores them in ClickHouse.

## **You are the only owner of all your data**

The overall architecture also ensures privacy aspects since all the data and communication stays within the system. It will not send any data to any third party service.
