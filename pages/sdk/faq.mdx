## How to get the SDK URLs

1. Go to the **Get Started** page.
2. Create a feature flag, or select an existing one and click **Next**.
3. In the **SDK Configs** section, you will see:
   - **Streaming URL** (`wss://...`): Used for real-time updates.
   - **Event URL** (`https://...`): Used for sending events.
     Both usually point to the [Evaluation Server Service (ELS)](../tech-stack/application-services#evaluation-server-service-els).

  **Note:** If you have custom infrastructure (e.g., have another ELS
  service deployed and designate it as the dedicated event server), the event URL
  may differ, check with your administrator if unsure.
