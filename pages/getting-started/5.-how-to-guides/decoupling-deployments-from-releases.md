# Decoupling deployments from releases

## Why **Decoupling deployments from releases**

Gain the confidence to deploy faster. Feature flags allow software teams to deploy a new feature to production whenever they want. The flag conceals the code pathway, thus reducing the risk of it residing on a production server. When you're ready to release the feature to users, simply toggle the relevant flag. By decoupling code deployments from feature releases, feature flags unlock a host of other modern development practices.

## Empower **Trunk-based development**

Feature flags, in acting as kill switches and separating deployments from releases, paving the way for trunk-based development. Teams mired in long-lived feature branches, merge conflicts, and aging pull requests (PRs) can find relief. With feature flags, you can comfortably merge imperfect code with the main branch in your version control system today and then pick up where you left off tomorrow. If the mainline gets pushed to the release branch, no sweat; users will be unable to interact with your flagged code.
