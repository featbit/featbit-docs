# 1. Create two feature flags

In this topic, you will learn how to create feature flags for the demo "Dino Game".

## Prerequisites

We assume that you have successfully installed FeatBit through [Docker Installation](../installation/full-installation.md).

## Login to the portal

Before creating the feature flag, you must log in to the portal. Open your browser, and open the website [`http://localhost:8081/`](http://localhost:8081/). Default username and password are:

* username: test@featbit.com
* password: 123456

![The "login" page.](../getting-started/assets/create-2-feature-flag/001-login.png)

If this is your first time login in, you need to specify your organization and project through the guide below. Click on the "Complete" button to finish this step.

![The "Initialize Organization" page.](../getting-started/assets/create-2-feature-flag/002-init-org.webp)

After completing the process above, you will be redirected to the feature flag list page. You will see an onboarding guide (shown in the image below).

## Create two flags for demo

### 1. Create a "game runner" feature flag

In the flag list, click **Add** button, and then texts "**game runner**" as the name of the feature flag.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  This feature flag will be used in the following topics, be sure you have the same information as the image below. The flag's key are case sensitive.
</Callout>

![Create "game runner" flag dialog.](../getting-started/assets/create-2-feature-flag/004.webp)

Click on the "Save" button to create the feature flag, then you will see the detail page of feature flag "game runner".

> See the article [Targeting users with flags](../feature-flags/targeting-users-with-flags/) to get more information about the Targeting tab.

### 2. Create a "difficulty mode" feature flag&#x20;

Go back to "the flag list", create a feature flag, and name it "**difficulty mode**".

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  This feature flag will be used in the following topics, be sure you have the same information as the image below. The flag's key are case sensitive.
</Callout>

![Create "difficulty mode" flag dialog.](../getting-started/assets/create-2-feature-flag/006.webp)

In the targeting page of this feature flag, find the flag variation area on the left side panel.

#### 1. To edit variation values

* Enter edit variations mode
* Modify the value of `true` to `hard`&#x20;
* Modify the value of `false` to `easy`
* Add a new variation with the value `normal`

#### 2. Changed the `DateType` from `boolean` to `string`

![Change flag variation.](../getting-started/assets/create-2-feature-flag/007.webp)

#### 3. Click on save button to save the modification.

You will see the return variations are changed:

1. The default rule section's return value is changed from `true` to `hard`
2. The return variation when feature flag is OFF is changed from `false` to `easy`

![After variation change saved.](../getting-started/assets/create-2-feature-flag/008.png)

## Next

**Congratulation**, now you have successfully created 2 feature flags, you will learn how to use these feature flags in the next topic ["Try interacting with the demo"](try-interacting-with-the-demo.md).
