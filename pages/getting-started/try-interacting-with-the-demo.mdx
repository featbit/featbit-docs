Turn on the feature flag, then go back to the demo page. You will see the "Dino Game" appear in the game area.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Turn on the flag means that the SDK will evaluate the feature flag and return `true` to the application. In reverse, if you turn off the flag, the SDK will return `false` to the application. `True` is typically used to enable the feature, and `false` is used to disable the feature, but it depends on how you use the feature flag in your application.
