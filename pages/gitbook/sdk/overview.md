# Overview

We are continuously dedicated to expanding our platform support. However, it is possible that the specific platform you are targeting may not currently have an available SDK. In such instances, we offer two alternatives:

* Utilize the API we have provided to retrieve all the feature flags. You can implement long polling to stay updated with the latest changes. Please refer to the documentation available [here ](retrieve-feature-flags-with-api.md)for more details.
* Create your own SDK by following the comprehensive instructions outlined in our [documentation](sdk-guidlines.md). By referring to the provided document, you can develop an SDK tailored specifically to your platform requirements.

We actively encourage and welcome contributions from developers who can help us bridge the gap by creating missing SDKs. If you successfully develop an SDK that aligns with our standards and are interested in collaborating, we would be thrilled to include your work as one of our community SDKs.
