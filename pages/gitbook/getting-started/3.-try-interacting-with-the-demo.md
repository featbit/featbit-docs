# 3. Try interacting with the demo

You created two feature flags "game runner" and "difficulty mode" in the last step, you can use these two flags to interact with the "Dino Game" demo.&#x20;

To interact with the demo, you open the "Quick start" panel then click on step "[3. Try interacting with the demo](3.-try-interacting-with-the-demo.md)". Then you will be directed to the "Dino Game" demo page.
